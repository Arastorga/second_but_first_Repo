# second_but_first_Repo
This is a change on this README

### And we are going to see how a README looks

"###" are headers.
we can put thing in **"negritas"** with "**" sandwiching a phrase
and bold leters like *this* with "*"

> This is a "cita" but with ">" but here i can put a **_Bolditalic_**
> I can do this with "**_" also sandwiching it

## In a good README we have:
1. Name of the project.
2. Description of this project.
3. How to install it.
4. How to use.
5. Help other to help us. How to contribute.
6. The Licence.

# Thank You.
